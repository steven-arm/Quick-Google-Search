# Interview Helper

A small Chrome extension that opens tabs based on recently asked questions.

Basically speech to text Google search.

## How to Use
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Z on an active, Mic Enabled page
2. Say your search query
3. Say "correct" to end the search query automatically
4. Wait for the tab to pop up with relevant information

### Limitations
* You sound like a robot when you ask for the "confirmation"
* If you need to cheat in a Job Interview, are you really skilled enough to get the job
* Requires a key press, might change it to be automatic
